                    and it doesn't involve potentially dangerous medication, oral hygene products 
                    or dental treatments of any kind.
                </p>

                    This <b>easy bedtime technique</b> has sent shockwaves through
                    the multi-bilion dollar dental industry, after thousands of people
                    utilizing this discovery have quickly <b>eliminated signs of tooth decay</b>, 
                    bleeding and receding gums, plaque build up, infection and bad breath.

                <p>
                    This long-term solution is so effective because it <b>attacks the fundamental cause of tooth
                        decay and gum disease</b>, rather than only treating the symptoms.
